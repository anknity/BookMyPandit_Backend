## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

This project adopts a modern decoupled architecture, separating the client interface from the API and services layer.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **Framework:** React.js built with Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized builds.
- **Styling & UI:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, ensuring a fully responsive and aesthetic modern design.
- **Animations:** Framer Motion powers rich layout animations, sticky headers, and smooth scroll effects.
- **Icons:** Lucide-React and custom SVG icons for a minimalist, premium look.

### Backend (`/backend`)
- **Server Environment:** Node.js with Express.js architecture (`controllers`, `routes`, `middleware`, `services`).
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for structured relational data storage, managed with SQL migration scripts.
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) architecture implemented for cross-device alerts.

## ⚙️ How the Project Works (Platform Workflow)

1. **Onboarding & Discovery:** 
   Users explore the platform via a highly animated, responsive homepage featuring dynamic banners. They can use the search bar to find matching Pujas or browse through high-rated Pandits.
2. **Booking Flow:**
   After selecting a Puja, the user chooses an available Pandit, confirms the time and location details, and completes the seamless checkout process.
3. **Pandit Verification & Engagement:**
   If a user wishes to offer services, they use the "Become a Pandit" form. Their application is paused in a pending state. An Administrator logs into the Admin Panel, reviews the documents, and approves the profile. The user is then granted access to the internal Pandit Dashboard to view their new bookings and earnings.
4. **Interactive Astrology:**
   Users seeking spiritual guidance can interact with the Astrology modules to draw Tarot Cards. The backend processes these requests (often leveraging integrated AI models like Sarvam AI) to provide unique, dynamic interpretations.
5. **Real-time Updates:**
   Throughout this lifecycle, FCM tokens ensure that both the User and Pandit receive immediate push notifications regarding booking statuses, messages, or administrative actions.

## ☁️ Deploy this Backend Repo on Render

When you move `backend/` into its own repository:

- Keep `Dockerfile` in the repo root.
- In Render, choose **Web Service** → **Deploy from Git**.
- Render auto-detects the root `Dockerfile` and builds it.

If you see `failed to read dockerfile: open Dockerfile: no such file or directory`, your build is being run from the wrong directory.

Local check (run in backend repo root):

```bash
docker build -t panditji-backend .
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

### 1. Using Docker (Recommended)
To run the entire stack (Frontend + Backend) simultaneously:
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. From the root directory (`/`), run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Frontend: `http://localhost:80` | Backend: `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Manual Setup

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Ensure .env is properly configured based on .env.example
npm run dev
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
